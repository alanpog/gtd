Glorious Things Done
======

Introduction
------
Glorious Things Done - or **gtd** for short - will be a command-line todo list
manager written in Haskell. It is inspired by [taskwarrior]
(http://taskwarrior.org/projects/show/taskwarrior).

Please be patient while we are implementing it.

FAQ
-------
* **Why another todo list manager?**

That's a good question and it deserves a good answer. If you take a look at
taskwarrior you will notice that it offers a lot of features. I've been using
taskwarrior for quite a long time and I noticed that I need only about 30% of
all existing features. With GTD I intend to follow KISS ideology and create a
simple todo list manager with no unnecessary features.

* **How do I report a bug or a feature request?**

It would be best if you filled a new issue on github. Alternatively, you can
send me an email. Please provide relevant details about your system (type,
version, GHC version and so on).

* **Why such name?**

Glorious Things Done supports Getting Things Done methodology. Or so I heard,
because I never actually read the book that introduced this approach. Anyway,
I took the word "Glorious" from Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler, which I'm
using to build this project.
